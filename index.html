        The last movie I watched was Clueless. 
        I like this movie because I think it's fun, funny, and an easy watch.
        I don't watch movies very much so if I do, I usually rewatch something I've already seen.
        This movie is a classic, lighthearted, and I love the seeing fashion in it.
